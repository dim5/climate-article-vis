## About

This is a web application created using React.js to supplement my Master's thesis, in which I collected and analyzed articles about climate change using various NLP tools.

The other half of the project is located here: [climate-article-analysis](https://github.com/dim5/climate-article-analysis).

Feel free to reach out to me should you want to read my thesis.

## Local development

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Then start a local instance:

```
npm start
```

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
